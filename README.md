# Task Jolly Web Application
Task Jolly is a task management webapp built in the form of a Kanban board with HTML, CSS, and Javascript (and jquery) technologies. This little project is aimed at providing users with a tool that they can use to stay organized on the web, while they are working on completing tasks.

# Tools and Technologies Used in This Project
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding languages
- VS Code platform used to code and build pages
- Bootstrap CSS Framework - Utilized for styling the website (getbootstrap.com)
- Web API's:
    - Day JS (dayjs.org)
- Github (website hosted and deployed on Github servers)

# How to Use
Upon accessing the website, click the "Add Task" button, which will pull up a modal pop up. This modal contains input fields and radio fields to input a title and description for that particular task. Additionally, the user can add a due date by which they want to complete that task. Once they click to add the task (after inputting information), then that newly created task will appear in the "To-Do" column. There are also two other columns named "In-Progress" and "Done" for tasks that the user is currently working on or has completed.

Task Jolly also enables users to click and drag the task cards in any one of the columns and then drop them into the column of their choosing. Task cards will stay and appear wherever they are dropped. Consequently, as users complete tasks, they have an option to delete a task (removing it from the DOM and local storage completely) by clicking the "Delete" button that is on each one of the task cards, for that particular task.
